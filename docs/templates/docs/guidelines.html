        <h2>A guide for the generic humanoid carbon unit</h2>

        <p>
            In order to make the Devcharm lists informative and fun to use and write we have prepared a set of easy guidelines to follow for the benefit of writers and readers alike!</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The title is the key - make it <strong>short</strong> (no more than 50 characters) and <strong>informative</strong>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The punchline - think Twitter! 140 characters and <strong>fun</strong>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The description - tell us what your list is about, why you decided to write it and what is your personal view on the topic. Try to stay below 500 characters.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The list item - please keep the link part short: one, two words. Every link needs a comprehensive description, telling the reader what will s/he find on the website/resource and why do you find it useful and relevant to the topic. Make it <strong>interesting</strong> and make it under 250 characters.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Sections - you might find it useful to divide your list into sections that help the reader to find the relevant information quickly and to maintain the flow of the list.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Some general stuff - a list should reflect <strong>your view</strong> on the topic, what you consider important and valuable and it should contain at least 5 links. Also, remember to keep the links connected and relevant - imagine a Devcharm list as an <strong>article</strong> on a specific topic. And last but not least: please spell check!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Spread the word!</strong>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Thank you!</p>
