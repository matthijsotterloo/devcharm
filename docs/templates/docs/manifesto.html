        <h2>Coding is hard. But beautiful.</h2>

        <p>
            Every day we spend countless hours on our editor, <strong>solving problems</strong> for us and for the millions
            of people who are using our software.
            And every day we crawl the Web for ideas, answers, reading documentation and source code, discovering new
            projects, and looking for inspiration.
            <strong>The Web has everything we need, and it's open and available to everyone.</strong> But it's our
            responsibility to make it accessible to everyone.
        </p>

        <p>
            DevCharm is a new network of hardcore Coders, Hackers, CTOs and Software architects, <strong>sharing what
            matters</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you are here <strong>to find inspiration and new ideas</strong>, go with our <a href="/">index page</a>.
            If you are just starting you might want to check out the
            <a href="/tag/intro">great resources we have for beginners</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you are asking <strong>why</strong> you should join Devcharm and <strong>share lists of resources</strong>,
            here are three things you should know:
        </p>

        <h2>1. Why go a&ndash;listing</h2>
        <p>
            Lists are versatile, they are stripped of all the unnecessary ornaments, they are to the point and easy to read
            and understand.
            By creating a list you do a lot of things at once. <strong>You make a statement</strong>. You share what you
            know. You ask questions.
            You answer problems. You organize what was chaotic. But above all &ndash; you talk with others.
        </p>
        <p>
            You code and you already know how to build a list &ndash; it’s fast and easy. Use it, it’s super effective.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Coding as publishing</h2>
        <p>
            You love your tools, and you love to have a complete control over what you write. A list is just text, so why
            complicate
            things with a baroque UI and formatting options? On&nbsp;Devcharm, <code>markdown</code> is the king and we even
            have some
            <a href="/docs/guidelines">guidelines</a> for that.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have also integrated a powerful client side editor with two nice features: <strong>Vim/Emacs
            keybinding</strong>
            (so you can feel at home), and a live preview of your list.
        </p>


        <h2>3. A place for developers</h2>
        <p>
            Devcharm is a safe haven for those who believe that solving problems and sharing programming knowledge matters.
            Our effort is to keep quality high, avoid spammy and unrelated content. But we are open to those who want
            to express their opinion on topics related to developing.<br>
